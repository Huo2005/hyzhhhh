    <h2>Personal Experience:</h2>
    <h3>Origin:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <p>When I was in elementary school, I watched an anime about basketball called Slam Dunk. In the anime, basketball changed the protagonist and the friendship the protagonist gained during basketball games. These deeply attracted me, and from then on, I began to love basketball</p>

        <strong>Pual George:</strong> Before talking about why he likes PG, let's first tell a story about him. In 2014, he suffered a 90 degree leg fracture injury. At that time, no one thought he could return to the field, but he only rested for less than 300 days before returning to the field. The time has come to the 2018-2019 season, which was my first season watching the NBA. That season, Paul George played his strongest season of his career, and his playing style was drifting, highly entertaining, and the players themselves were very handsome. Therefore, I became a fan of Paul George from that season on.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kawhi Leonard:</strong>This is a strong player. In 2019, he joined the Clippers with Paul George and demonstrated the strongest strength in the league on the court. He is very low-key when playing and rarely has intense emotions. He often remains expressionless and does not show his anger or anger. He uses his strength on the court to win over opponents and spectators, and is greeted with cheers. Moreover, Leonard has a strong playing style, comprehensive skills, and excellent offensive and defensive abilities. He can use his outstanding shooting ability to end the game, or use his steel like muscles to create space for himself when breaking through. His playing style is sometimes delicate, sometimes explosive, and highly entertaining. In addition, he teamed up with Paul George, and I fell in love with this player

  <h3>Favorite Teams:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;" >
      <strong>Clippers:</strong> Not only because there are stars I like on the team, but also because it is a team full of miracles. In the 2021 playoffs, the Clippers reversed and won after losing two consecutive games at the beginning of two rounds. In addition, with Leonard injured, Paul George led the team to the Western Conference Finals, creating the best record in Clippers history. In the following season, despite Paul George and Kawhi Leonard missing most of the games, they still played eighth in the division and completed a 35 point comeback. This team will always perform strongly when the outside world is generally not optimistic, responding to all doubts from the outside world. Such a team will always give fans hope, let fans see the passion of the team, and make fans also full of passion.

    <li style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Shanxi Team of CBA:</strong>The main reason why I like it is that it is a team from my hometown. I have visited the home stadium of Shanxi team several times to watch their basketball games, witnessing countless classic moments, their past lows, and their current strength. Although we are not always a strong team, Shanxi team has a tough playing style and never gives up. The fans are always passionate and love Shanxi team. The Shanxi team has a slogan based on dialects, which in Putonghua is "Shanxi Nao Ta". In this scene, it is a slogan for Shanxi fans to cheer for the Shanxi team and wish them a smooth victory over their opponents. Listening to the uniform slogans of the fans at home, watching Shanxi team win, and finally cheering for the victory with the fans, I can clearly feel my sense of honor as a Shanxi person and sincerely feel happy for Shanxi's victory.</li>

  </ul> 
  <h3>Reason For Selection:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">Basketball has brought me a lot of things and influenced me in many ways. I secretly wake up in the middle of the night to watch my favorite team's game, and my mood is affected by the team's loss. When writing essays for exams, I often write examples about basketball, and even replace my WeChat avatar with my favorite star. I also buy the jerseys of my favorite star. Basketball has had a huge impact on me as a sport.</li>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">I love basketball very much and often play basketball with my classmates. Whenever I play basketball, I feel very happy. In games, I also understand the importance of teamwork. For example, if someone needs to give their all in the attack, then someone also needs to be a barrier on the defensive end. At the beginning of watching the game, I didn't have much understanding of basketball, but as my love grew, I started to focus not only on player data, but also on understanding the tactical arrangements of different teams and trying to have my own understanding and analysis during the game. Whenever someone told me they liked basketball, I would share my views with them and feel very happy. In this process, my understanding of basketball gradually deepened, and I became more and more interested in basketball.</li>
